# Tweeter Project

Tweeter will render an in-browser interface and interact with a JSON API. The client will be a Single Page Application (SPA) that has all the functionality on one page and communicates asynchronously with the server.

It's a great project to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express back-end skills.
